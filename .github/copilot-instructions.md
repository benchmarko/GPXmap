This project is a Vite-based TypeScript web app that displays waypoints from a GPX file on a Leaflet map. Prioritize code that helps with:
- Parsing GPX files (XML format)
- Displaying waypoints as markers on a Leaflet map
- Providing a user-friendly file upload interface
- Using modern, idiomatic TypeScript and web standards
